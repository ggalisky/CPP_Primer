This repo will be home to my notes and exercises for C++ Primer 5th edition. I will be referencing this repo to make sure my solutions are on the right track: https://github.com/jaege/Cpp-Primer-5th-Exercises/blob/master/ch1/1.5.cpp

Although I have a good chunk of informal experience with C++, I'd like to formalize that experience by working my way through the C++ Primer. I'm sure I'll learn some new stuff along the way. 

This readme will also serve as my logbook for how my progress is going.
